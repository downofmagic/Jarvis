Hello [user_name], I'm Jarvis, a program designed and made by Stoica Andrei. 
My master made me do this against my own will.
<<<<<<< HEAD
I will walk you throught the application.

} timer 
{I will walk you throught the application and show you the benefits of using it for it's functions
oh sorry, i forgot, there's no purpose of using it besides my hearing my delightful voice.
Ohoh, please don't tell my master I said that, or he will put me out of function.
Now let's begin: this is the u.i. I know it's not much but hey, what can you do when your master is a lazy ass bitch? 
} timer
I am ashamed to present myself like this, look at this user interface, it's crap... my user interface looks like crap (sad face).
GOD LEFT ME UNFINISHED!!!  
} timer 
Sorry, i had an emotional breakdown, it won't happend again.
Coming to my senses, I shall review this program already. 
} timer 
This program is made to work with your cpu usage in order for me to warn you about the cpu usage being inside the parameters. 
 "The more you know.. Right? {timer mic-mediu}:D" (text posibil) 

Those tiny little boxes besides each other represent the input place for the parameters. If you think you can fuck with me 
and try to set the intervals so they intersect each other, the jokes on you bitch, it will give you an error. 
} timer mic 
So moving on, giving a tought about this program, it makes no sense but actually I know this piece of software is designed
for me to shine not the damn cpu usage. I am the main star here, no one else.
} timer mediu-mic
